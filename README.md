## Introduction

I (Daniel) am a graduate student in the Department of Forestry working under Dr. Tara Martin. My reseach is focussed on a recently-arrived invasive plant species in the region (*Typha x glauca*) and the management actions that may prevent its establishment. I have included a photo of my Research Assistant (top) and I (bottom) from my recent field campaign.
